June 5th: 

Bug introduced in version 1.1.1 fixed: with models where there is a singlet contracted with other fields. I introduced a fix for the permutations of indices but missed out one case which was never encountered in the demo model files. In case it was encoutered the program would crash. Therefore, no wrong results coudl have been produced.

April 15 th:

Version 1.2.0_beta finalized: 
	* New key word CGCs allowing to deal with multiple gauge singlets for a
	given term
	* Please read NewsInPyR@TE-1.2.0.html before using
	* Add the non public implementation of the sparse matrices

March 8th : 

Bug fixed introduced in previous version...Thanks to M. Arshad Momen for
pointing this out


February 25th 2015:
Bug Fixed: the singlets position in quartic terms was still influencing the
results ! 

January 18th:
Bug fixed introduced in version 1.0.5 when yukawa matrices are not squared.

NOvember 13th 2014:
Bug fixed in the FermionMasses at two-loop. No impact on the physics.

September 8th 2014:
Bug introduced in pyrate-1.1.3 fixed. All the gauge groups were being added a dummy Group. Thanks to Debtosh Chowdhury for bringing this to my attention.

July 23rd:
Create a dummy SU(n) group when only abelian group factors are present because it is required for the algorithm that perform the derivative of the potential.
e.g. phi^4 theory

june 5th:
Bug fixed in the mixing of multiple quartic terms when some scalars were charged under several groups, pyrate was skipping the calculation.
Also removed the "letter" option in the latex output
Thanks to Daniel Busbridge for bringing this issue to my attention

May 12th : 
Bug  fixed in the latex output when a yukawa with identical two fermions was generated --> Wrong indices
Thanks to K. Karnike

April 24th:
1) Corrected an output visual namely that when calculating combinations because it was impossible to disentengle everything, some "+0+0" appeared in the results

February 25th:

1) Implementation of the possibility to deal with sum of terms
2) Improve the disentangle and if not possible then calculate a possible
combination 
3) Merge the skip and Only options

December 6th :

1) remove the need to declare the real degrees of freedom for the complex scalar fields. 
2) Corrected all the models correspondingly
Note that you can still use the old definition



October 29 : 
Introduction of the Neglecting term list
October 29 :

Fix of the logfile system

October 22 :

Fix when a gauge group is spectator. 
Add a check for the qnbs of the real degrees of freedom versus the cplx fields it comes from

October 11 :

Fix in the product matrix reconstruction 
plus input file when anything that looks like MatM is used for parameters
October 10 :
